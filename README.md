# Blueprint Frontend Challenge

## Challenge Description

Thank you for taking the time to apply to the Blueprint Project Teams and participating in this frontend challenge. In this challenge you will be creating the following features in a simple React application:

1. A form that takes 3 fields: Name, Email, and Graduation Year. Users should be able to enter their information in these fields. When they press submit, the information they entered should show in a table below the form.

2. Fetch from local JSON file. From name.json 

You can refer to this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/CYHTDweja1x3V58aNAfSfZ/Blueprint-Frontend-Assessment-S24?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=luLjweYk40pUovrH-0) for a better representation of what we would like to see. You do NOT have to implement the designs exactly. This Figma is provided as a general structure - think of it as what you might receive from a designer and it is up to you to implement it. 

You can use any additional libraries that you like and you can perform styling however you wish (Vanilla CSS, Tailwind, SCSS, etc.). If you have any questions about this challenge, please do not hesitate to reach out to Shawn Aviles (saviles26@stevens.edu) or Christian Apostol (caposto1@stevens.edu).
